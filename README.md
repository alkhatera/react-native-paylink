## 💻 Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-paylink
```

or

```sh
yarn add react-native-paylink
```

## 📱 Minimal Usage

Opening and closing the bottom sheet is done imperatively, so just pass a `ref` to the bottom sheet and call the `open` or `close` methods via the `ref` instance to open and close the bottom sheet respectively.

## Examples

#### Javascript

```tsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import { ReactNativePaylink } from 'react-native-paylink';

const App = () => {
  const sheetRef = useRef(null);
  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Open" onPress={() => sheetRef.current?.open()} />
      <ReactNativePaylink ref={sheetRef} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

### ⚠ Warning

The bottom sheet component [react-native-bottom-sheet](https://github.com/stanleyugwu/react-native-bottom-sheet) uses and handles pan gestures internally, so to avoid scroll/pan misbehavior with its container, **DO NOT** put it inside a container that supports panning e.g `ScrollView`. You can always put it just next to the `ScrollView` and use `React Fragment` or a `View` to wrap them and everything should be okay.

#### ❌ Don't do this

```jsx
<ScrollView>
  <ReactNativePaylink>...</ReactNativePaylink>
</ScrollView>
```

#### ✅ Do this

```jsx
<>
  <ScrollView>...</ScrollView>

  <ReactNativePaylink>...</ReactNativePaylink>
</>
```
